# Crypto Exchange

# Todo

> api

- Add fullName field + profileImage field to User model
- Add some type of balance history, so we can let the user how much money they've made overall, compared to their initial investment.

**make sure api responds with this updated information on all endpoints**

> client

- Show user image, fullName, and overall balance performance in their profile tab
- Add filter section in homepage, where users can only view crypto cards that they're currently invested into.
  - Add a greyed out filtered option of "bookmarked", so in the future we can implement bookmarking crypto cards.
  - have these filters work together with our sorting to provide these two effects together.
